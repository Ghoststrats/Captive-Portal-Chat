# Captive-Portal-Chat
GhostStrats Portal Chat
This HTML file is designed to work with the BLE Shark Nano. When you upload it to your Nano, it becomes a local captive portal that shows a private message after a password is entered.

Everything runs offline and is stored inside the HTML file.

Instructions:

Open the HTML file in any text editor.

Edit the message:
Look for the section in the code that says:

<!-- This is where you write the message to display after login -->
Replace the example message with your own.

Change the password:
Scroll to the script section and find:
const correctPassword = "GhostStrats";
Replace "GhostStrats" with your own password.

Save the file.

Upload the updated HTML file to your BLE Shark Nano.

How it works:

Devices that connect to your BLE Shark Nano will be redirected to this portal.

They must enter the password to see the hidden message.

The message and password are both stored in the code and can be changed anytime.

Use Responsibly:

This tool is for educational and personal use only. Do not use it to deceive, harm, or invade the privacy of others. You are responsible for how you deploy it.
